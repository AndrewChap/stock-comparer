# stock-comparer

A web application for comparing a few different stocks.  Made with Dash/Plotly.

## Demo
Also made a Jupyter notebook for comparing a few different stocks.  Get the [Stock-comparer Notebook](https://github.com/AndrewChap/stock-comparer/blob/master/stock-comparer.ipynb).  Plotted with Plotly

## To-Do's
* Make original logo
* Make ENTER always redraw the plot
* Get Google Ads on page
* When there is bad input, make it red and pop up text that says so
* Checkbox to make it a semilog-y plot
* Add in calendar selector for dates (Dash's DatePicker doesn't seem to work well, so look into getting another tool into Dash)
* Plot hovers should show actual price of stock data (or have a checkbox list to choose what to display)
* Improve performance by not fetching stock data redundantly
